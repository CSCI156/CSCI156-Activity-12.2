#### 1. l =[[1,2],[1,-1],[5,8],[-4,-2],[4,3]]
      D. l is a list of ordered pairs. Use a for loop to create a list M which contains the largest element 
      for each of the ordered pairs and the ordered pairs as a tuple.
      M =[(2,[1,2]),(1,[1,-1]),(8,[5,8]),(-2,[-4,-2]),(4,[4,3])]
      (max is a built in function)
      S. Sort M
      U. Return the list L sorted in order by the maximum element. If there is a tie how is the list sorted?

Your program should work for any list L, not just the one I provided here.

#### 2. Write a function mean which will compute the average of any number of numbers:
```
mean(1,2) = 1.5
mean(1,2,3) = 2
etc.
```
